# RBY CAP

A Red and Blue ROM hack based on [RBY CAP](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/3.3737699/) using [pret's](github.com/pret) pokered disassembly.

I highly encourage that you check out the tier!

You can play RBY CAP on [Dragon Heaven](http://petmodsdh.com/).

Info for the CAPmons can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki) or [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B4zGi6cBzuy3Vrfhz59VJsjdXtS1Bh60UFUOwzBmVGQ/edit?gid=955529693#gid=955529693).

# What's New?
Of course, being called Create-a-Pokémon, RBY CAP adds quite a few new Pokémon to Gen 1.

So far, there are seven finished CAPmons, all of which are featured in this ROM hack:
- [Corupcake](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Corupcake)
- [Gargoyle](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Gargoyle)
- [Phantom](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Phantom)
- [Mandrelec](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Mandrelec)
- [Spriguin](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Spriguin)
- [Pineguin](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Pineguin)
- [Probosicle](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Probosicle)
- [Sparophim](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Sparophim)
<br/>

These CAPmons have also brought their own signature moves to shake up the competitive scene:
- [Sugar Rush](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Sugar-Rush)
- [Marble Fist](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Marble-Fist)
- [Camouflage](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Camouflage)
- [Icicle](https://github.com/coastergat/rbCAP/wiki/Icicle)
<br/>

RBY CAP features a variety of QoL changes:
- Trade evolutions are now tied to the Linking Cord
- Infinite buyable TMs and evolution stones
- Move deleter and relearner
- Hyper training
- One-time choice Pokémon (ie the hitmons and starters) can be obtained in the wild


RBY CAP is a competitive format, the majority of these changes were made to make teambuilding as efficient and accessible as possible.

- Uses Yellow's sprites and color palettes
- All CAP creators featured in the game credits!
- More to be added...
